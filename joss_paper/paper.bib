  abstract  = "Though open source data acquisition (DAQ) systems have been
               published, closed source proprietary systems are the standard
               despite often being prohibitively expensive. High costs,
               however, limit access to high-quality DAQ in low-resource
               settings. In many cases the functions executed by the closed
               source and proprietary DAQ cards could be carried out by an open
               source alternative; however, as desired function count
               increases, the simplicity of integrating the designs decreases
               substantially. Although the global library of open source
               electronic designs is expanding rapidly, and there is clear
               evidence they can reduce costs for scientists one device at a
               time, they are generally made to carry a function well, but are
               often not capable of scaling up or easily being integrated with
               other designs. Just as other open source projects have found
               success by having modular frameworks and clearly documented
               specifications, a framework to unify and enable interoperation
               of these open source electronics systems would be greatly
               beneficial to the scientific community. To meet these needs and
               ensure greater accessibility to high-quality electronics sensing
               and DAQ systems, this article shares and tests a news framework
               where new open source electronics can be developed and have
               plug-and-play functionality. The Broadly Reconfigurable and
               Expandable Automation Device (BREAD), consists of a basic set of
               guidelines and requirements to which others can contribute. Here
               7 slices (boards) are provided, demonstrated, and validated: 1)
               Amplified Analog Input, 2) Audio Analysis / Fourier Transform,
               3) +/- 10A Current Sensor, 4) 4-Channel Relay Controller 5) 4
               Channel Stepper Motor Controller, 6) 4 Channel Type-K
               Thermocouple Reader and 7) 2 Channel USB Port. Implementing
               systems using BREAD rather than closed source and proprietary
               alternatives can result in cost savings of up to 93\%.",

  abstract  = "Low-cost high-resolution metal 3-D printing remains elusive for
               the scientific community. Low-cost gas metal arc wire
               (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive
               manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has
               limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing
               process. To begin to monitor and thus control these
               complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D
               printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring.
               Building on this prior work, in this study, the design,
               fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is
               described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system
               for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes
               voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and
               temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested
               here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring
               the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and
               microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the
               presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of
               quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most
               impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency
               sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic
               ``good weld'' peak frequency.",

               are important parameters in designing flexible measurement

               open-source measurement system based on consumer hardware for

               modules are integrated into an USB-based measurement interface

               Open-source hardware tools exist for implementing these
               processes individually; however, they are not easily integrated
               with other designs. The Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable
               Automation Device (BREAD) is a framework that provides many
               open-source devices which can be connected to create more
               complex data acquisition and control systems. This article
               explores the feasibility of using BREAD plug-and-play open
               hardware to quickly design and test monitoring and control
               electronics for an industrial materials processing prototype
               pyrolysis reactor. Generally, pilot-scale pyrolysis plants are
               expensive custom designed systems. The plug-and-play prototype
               approach was first tested by connecting it to the pyrolysis
               reactor and ensuring that it can measure temperature and actuate
               heaters and a stirring motor. Next, a single circuit board
               system was created and tested using the designs from the BREAD
               prototype to reduce the number of microcontrollers required.
               Both open-source control systems were capable of reliably
               running the pyrolysis reactor continuously, achieving equivalent
               performance to a state-of-the-art commercial controller with a
               ten-fold reduction in the overall cost of control. Open-source,
               plug-and-play hardware provides a reliable avenue for
